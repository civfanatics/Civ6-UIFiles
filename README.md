# Civ6-UIFiles
## What Is Here
These files are a copy of the unmodifed UI script files (XML, LUA, and SQL) that ship with Civilization 6.  The primary purpose of these files is to act as a reference point when modding; especially when a new patch is released.
As a patch is released, the files will also be updated in this repo.  History on each individual file should show the changes made by Firaxis/2K with each patch they have released.
